Based on the training log you provided, the primary reason for the relatively low validation accuracy (39.71%) despite the training process running for 15 epochs is likely underfitting or limited model capacity relative to the complexity of the data.Here's a breakdown of the possible reasons:📉 Model Underfitting (High Bias)Underfitting occurs when the model is too simple or has not been trained for long enough to capture the underlying patterns in the training data, leading to poor performance on both the training and validation sets.Low Training Accuracy: The training accuracy only reaches a maximum around $45.60\%$ (Epoch 9) and ends at $39.41\%$ (Epoch 15). A high-performing model should typically achieve a much higher training accuracy, ideally near $100\%$ if the data is easy to classify or significantly better than the validation accuracy if there is some overfitting. The low training accuracy suggests the model is struggling to learn even the data it sees during training.High Training and Validation Loss: The training loss remains relatively high, starting at $2.0452$ and only decreasing to around $1.5625$ (Epoch 10) before fluctuating. The validation loss is also consistently high (around $1.6-1.8$). In a successful classification task, you would expect the loss to be significantly lower.Lack of Clear Convergence: The metrics are erratic and don't show a clear, smooth trend towards a much better result. The validation accuracy fluctuates between $27.94\%$ and $42.65\%$ without a definitive upward trend towards a high value.💡 Possible Contributing Factors1. Model Architecture IssuesInsufficient Model Capacity: The model might not have enough layers or neurons to learn the complexity of your dataset. If you are using a simple model (e.g., a shallow CNN or a small fully-connected network) on a complex dataset (e.g., high-resolution images or diverse natural language data), it may simply lack the power to classify the data effectively.Incorrect Final Layer or Loss Function:For a classification task with multiple classes, the final layer should typically use a Softmax activation function, and the loss function should be Categorical Cross-entropy or Sparse Categorical Cross-entropy. Using an incorrect combination can severely limit learning and accuracy.2. Dataset IssuesNumber of Classes: If your task is multi-class classification, an accuracy of $\sim 40\%$ is barely better than random chance for a large number of classes. For example, in a 10-class problem, random guessing gives $10\%$ accuracy. If it's a 3-class problem, $33.3\%$ is random chance. The low accuracy relative to the loss suggests the model is confused.Data Quality or Feature Scaling:Poorly Preprocessed Data: If the input data is not normalized or standardized correctly (e.g., pixel values not scaled to $[0, 1]$), the gradient descent algorithm can struggle to converge efficiently.Noisy or Mislabeled Data: High levels of noise or errors in the labels of the training data will prevent the model from achieving high accuracy.Small Dataset Size: If the dataset is very small, the model may not have enough examples to generalize well, leading to a low maximum achievable accuracy. Given only 9 steps per epoch, your batch size is small or your training set is small.3. Training Hyperparameter IssuesLearning Rate: If the learning rate is too low, the model learns too slowly and may not have reached a good solution within 15 epochs. While not the most likely cause for such low initial accuracy, it contributes to slow progress.Insufficient Epochs: While 15 epochs are not a lot, the metrics suggest that even more training might not fix the underfitting fundamentally, as the model isn't learning well at all. However, training for a few more epochs might show if the learning process eventually stabilizes at a higher accuracy.🛠️ Next Steps to Address the IssueTo improve your model's performance, you should consider the following steps:Increase Model Capacity:Add more layers or neurons to your network (e.g., more filters, deeper layers).If using an established architecture (like a popular CNN), try a larger version.Verify Data Preparation:Ensure all data is properly scaled and preprocessed.Double-check that the labels and input shapes are correct for your chosen loss function.Hyperparameter Tuning:Experiment with a higher learning rate initially, as the loss is not decreasing quickly.Train for more epochs (e.g., 50 or 100) to ensure the model has fully converged.Visualize and Analyze:Plot the training loss/accuracy and validation loss/accuracy curves to confirm the underfitting trend.Inspect a few of the images or data points that the model is consistently misclassifying to understand what makes them difficult.
